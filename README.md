### Description for the GitHub Repository

**Siamese Neural Network for Face Verification**

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of a Siamese Neural Network for face verification using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The project demonstrates the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a one-shot learning context, enabling the identification of whether two given face images belong to the same person.

#### Repository Contents:
- **`DLSiameseNetwork.py`**: Python script implementing the Siamese Network, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation pipelines. The code leverages PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning for modularity and efficiency.
- **`Report.pdf`**: A comprehensive report detailing the project's objectives, methodology, experimental setup, results, and insights.

#### Key Features:
- **Dataset Processing**: Preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve model robustness, including resizing, grayscale conversion, and random transformations.
- **Model Architecture**: A Siamese Neural Network with a shared CNN for feature extraction and a fully connected network for similarity evaluation.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Implements cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance, achieving test accuracy of 78.4%.
- **Reproducibility**: Includes scripts for downloading and preparing the LFW dataset, making it easy to replicate and build upon the experiments.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to enhance this implementation further!
